# **üí° Stroke Risk Prediction Project**

Welcome to the **Stroke Risk Prediction Project**! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of stroke based on various health and demographic factors. The project is structured into multiple phases, each handled by a dedicated team member.

---

## **üìÇ Project Description**

### **Code Structure**
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to predict stroke risk.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the **Healthcare Stroke Dataset**, which contains features like age, gender, BMI, glucose levels, and more.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Requirements**

### **For VS Code**
1. Install the Python extension for VS Code.
2. Install Jupyter extension for running `.ipynb` files.
3. Ensure the Python interpreter is set to the virtual/conda environment.

### **For PyCharm**
1. Install the Python plugin (if not already installed).
2. Configure the Python interpreter to point to the virtual/conda environment.
3. Install the Jupyter plugin for running notebooks.
